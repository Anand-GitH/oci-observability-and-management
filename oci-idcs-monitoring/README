Oracle Identity Cloud Service (IDCS)  is designed to extend enterprise controls by automating PaaS and SaaS account provisioning and deprovisioning, simplifying the user experience for accessing cloud applications by providing seamless integration with enterprise identity stores and authentication services, and facilitating compliance activities by clearly reporting on cloud application usage. It touches almost all the systems in the IT environment so it is important to monitor it continuously to ensure its secure and identify any vulnerabilities proactively.

This Reference Architecture describes Logging Analytics based solution for collecting, processing, enriching and analyzing Oracle IDCS Audit Logs for continuous monitoring and troubleshooting. An OCI Function pulls logs from IDCS REST API Endpoints regularly and ingest them in Logging Analytics for monitoring with IDCS Audit Analysis Dashboard.
